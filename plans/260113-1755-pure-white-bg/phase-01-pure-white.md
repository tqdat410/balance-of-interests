# Phase 1: Set Background to Pure White

## Objectives

- Change `--clay-bg` to `#ffffff` immediately.

## Tasks

### Implementation
1. **Update `lib/styles/clay-tokens.css`**:
   - Change `--clay-bg: #f0f4f8;` to `--clay-bg: #ffffff;`.

### Testing
1. Verify background is pure white.
2. Verify cards are still visible via their shadows (Claymorphism relies heavily on shadows, so this should still work, just less contrast).

### Code Review
1. Confirm exact hex code `#ffffff`.
